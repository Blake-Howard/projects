Lab 6


1. The cs pin selects which slave to communicate with by lowering the line, and sending a byte.
2. The CS pin is set high after initialization, because it's telling the slave it's not ready to communicate yet
	The read and write functions in f3d_gyro.c also set the pin high and low. The pin is set low, which means 
	information is about to be written or read, and sets the pin high, to let the slave know communication is finished. 
3. You would connect the devices on the same SCLK, MOSI, and MISO, but they would each have their own slave select line so each 
	device would know when communication is needed with it. 
4. The Baud rate prescaler is set to 8, resulting in an SPI clock of 9MHz.
5. Yes the peripheral devices need to be configured. On-the-fly changes need to be available if different peripherals are running
	on different speed. 

I found this lab extremely difficult. I really need to learn more about bits and bit shifting. I also know much 
more about how the initialization process works, and discovered that if things aren't initilized correctly
that you can effectively brick the board. I had 3 different boards that wouldn't download code anymore. I discovered
that this was due to incorrect initialization with my user button driver. I fixed it and now it works correctly.
