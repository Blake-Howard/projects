We accomplished extending dump.c to make it print all the formats specified. 

The difficulties started (as they often do) at the beginning figuring out exactly what format characters
would produce which output. The next difficulty was figuring out how to print certain formats on certain lines.
The final was seeing how the formatting should be, in order to copy the format given to us in lab. 

Overcoming the formatting characters was easy, we just needed to look them up. The main challenge was making
the lines print where they needed to be. Ben had a great idea of copying different strings to a variable
and printing out that variable, and I helped him implement this with if statements containing modulo. The 
formatting just took a litte time, research, and expirimentation to figure out how to make it look like the 
lab manual's table. 

I learned a few things from my partner, actually. I didn't know about ternary statements, and I'm glad I know
what they are and how to use them now. I can already see where they could be useful, and of course I learned
about different formatting characters and how to format these how I wanted, which is helpful.
